#todo-app

Basic Todo App created using HTML/ CSS/ JS
This is a very basic todo app written in JS, this is just a starter project i have developed and maintaining here.

It has the basic functionality of a todo app which are adding, deleting and removing all the todos.

The JS is written in a modular way so because I love it this way, I learnt it from Jonas Schmedtmann "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!" course. Highly Recommended! check it out. 

Other than this basic CSS and HTML is used. Because the focus of the app is ofcourse Javascript.
